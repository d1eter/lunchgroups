# Ruby on Rails Code Challenge for DataGuard

A simple Ruby on Rails App that
The groups should be of equal size (as much as possible) and employees of the same
unit (e.g. HR, IT) should be spread as much as possible in the different groups.
Every week, new groups are supposed to be different than in the previous weeks.
There is a button which will generate the list of groups.

[*Here is the deployed App *](https://www.#.com/)

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```
In case you’ve previously installed a version of a gem (such as Rails itself) other than the one specified by the Gemfile, it’s a good idea to update the gems with bundle update to make sure the versions match
```
$ bundle update
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
